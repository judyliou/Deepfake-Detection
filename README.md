# Deepfake-Detection

Deepfake is a technique to generate realistic videos and photos of fake events with a high potential
to deceive, which may mislead viewersâ€™ information consumption. It is a source of misinformation,
intimidation, harassment, and manipulation when being malevolently used. Therefore, how to detect
deepfakes has become a serious problem. To solve this problem, some tech companies and academics
cooperate to build the deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) on Kaggle, and we want to leverage
deep learning algorithms to come up with innovative methods to detect these manipulated videos.
